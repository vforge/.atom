## One dark Shade UI theme

A dark UI theme, based on the original One dark UI theme, with some subtle, relaxing tweaks.

### Tweaks
The main difference between Shade and the original One dark UI is that the filesystem tree gets a lower-contrast styling with de-emphasized icons -- allowing the eyes to focus more on the main editor without competition and distraction.
