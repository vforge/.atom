## 3.0.1
* [Fix core installation issues on Windows because of maximum path limit being exceeded due to Composer generating temporary files during ZIP extraction](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base/issues/303)

## 3.0.0
* Update to core [3.0.0](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/3.0.0).
* Settings are now grouped into sections and their descriptions have been cleaned up.
  * It is possible you may need to reconfigure your settings. Due to the way Atom saves them, it is recommended to remove your old settings from your config file first (see `Edit` â†’ `Config...`), to prevent Atom from showing old settings (as if they were still configurable) in the base package settings panel.
* Linting has been moved to this package. Due to refactoring in the core, the amount of CoffeeScript boilerplate has considerably reduced.
  * You no longer need the php-integrator-linter package installed. As it will no longer be updated to the new service version, it should disable automatically.
  * Linting has been updated to the new v2 API.
  * Linting on save is now supported (https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-linter/issues/49).
    * To disable it, disable indexing continuously.
* Call tips (or "signature help") has been moved to this package. Due to refactoring in the core, the amount of CoffeeScript boilerplate has considerably reduced.
  * You no longer need the php-integrator-call-tips package installed. As it will no longer be updated to the new service version, it should disable automatically.
* Tooltips are now provided by the core. The size of the CoffeeScript side has, as a consequence, shrunk considerably and is part of this package.
  * HTML and markdown in docblocks is now properly supported when displaying tooltips.
  * Tooltips are now displayed in a dock instead. This fixes the open issues regarding stuck tooltips, scrolling being impossible, keyboard activation being missing and tooltips not being permanently viewable.
    * A new option `Show Documentation` will now show up in the [intentions](https://github.com/steelbrain/intentions) list (also used in the refactoring package).
  * You no longer need the php-integrator-tooltips package installed. As it will no longer be updated to the new service version, it should disable automatically.
* `semanticLint` has been renamed to just `lint` as it also lints syntax errors.
* You will now be prompted to install the dependencies of this package (project-manager, linter, ...). If you proceed, they will be installed for you (so you don't need to look them up manually).
* You can now disable linting missing documentation separately from linting docblock correctness.
* Fixed the PHP server still starting for non-PHP projects in some cases, e.g. when opening a PHP file there (https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base/issues/272).
* Fix databases called `null.sqlite` sometimes being created.
* Fix project names containing characters that can't be used in file paths generating errors (such as forward slashes, asterisks, ...).
* Removed usage of jQuery and removed it from the list of dependencies.

## 2.1.13
* Add upgrade message.

## 2.1.12
* Update to core [2.1.7](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.1.7).

## 2.1.11
* Update to core [2.1.6](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.1.6).

## 2.1.10
* Update to core [2.1.5](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.1.5).

## 2.1.9
* Nothing changed, `apm` just failed to publish 2.1.8 and decided to bump the version, even though I explicitly asked it to try and publish 2.1.8 again.

## 2.1.8
* Update to core [2.1.4](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.1.4).

## 2.1.7
* Update to core [2.1.3](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.1.3).

## 2.1.6
* Update to core [2.1.2](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.1.2).
* Socket closes and reconnections will no longer display errors to the user. See also 46fc09f9b072a601dd6f6b02ee753a9785bfa397.

## 2.1.5
* When the socket connection closes and a reconnect happens, the state of response reading is now reset.
  * Previously, the base package kept accumulating response data in a buffer, never seeing the end of the one that was interrupted.

## 2.1.4
* Update to core [2.1.1](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.1.1).
* Composer output will no longer be silenced when installing the core.

## 2.1.3
* Fix incorrect method call that only occurred on shutdown or when deactivating the package.
* All open requests will now be rejected whenever the socket is unexpectedly closed.
  * This fixes the issue where some requests would hang up because the promise they received was never resolved or rejected.
    * This should fix the issue where indexing gets stuck (and blocks further indexing events) whenever the socket reconnects.

## 2.1.2
* Sockets closing without an error code will now warn instead of throw an error.
  * Socket connections that _do_ have an error code will still show an error message.
  * An attempt to automatically reestablish the socket connections will always be made.
  * In the case that the server crashed, an error will still also be printed in the developer tools, to distinguish between seemingly "magic self-closing" and actual server crashes.

## 2.1.1
* Fix another issue where the server wasn't always properly restarted after it unexpectedly stopped.
* Explicitly close open socket connections when the server dies as a safety measure (as the port is reused when the server is spawned again).

## 2.1.0
* Update to core [2.1.0](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.1.0).
* The server wasn't always being restarted automatically when it died or the connection failed. This should be fixed now.
* The core is now downloaded using Composer instead of apm, which is more robust and allows properly selecting the right version to download.

## 2.0.2
* Update to core [2.0.2](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.0.2).

## 2.0.1
* Update to core [2.0.1](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/tags/2.0.1).

## 2.0.0
### Features and enhancements
* The PHP side is no longer part of the base package. Instead, it has been separated into the [php-integrator/core](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core) repository so it can be more easily installed via Composer for use in other projects.
  * This change should not impact users as they upgrade, as this package will be automatically installed and upgraded along with this one if necessary (a notification will be shown whenever that happens).
* Communication with the core now happens via sockets. This means only a single process is spawned on startup and kept active throughout the lifetime of Atom.
  * This should reduce latency across the board as process spawning is rather expensive in comparison. It will also ensure there is never more than one process active when multiple requests are fired simultaneously (they will simply be queued and handled one by one, which will not freeze up Atom as communication is completely asynchronous).
  * It is now also possible to specify an additional indexing delay via the settings screen.
    * It's currently set to `200 ms` by default. As Atom's default delay before invoking an event after an editor stopped changing is about `300 ms`, this results in indexing happening after `500 ms` by default. Increasing this will reduce the load of constant reindexing happening, but will also make results from autocompletion and linting less current.
* Error messages will now be shown if setting up the current project fails because there is no active project or the project manager service is not available.
* Caching has been improved, improving performance and responsiveness.
  * Previously, similar queries to the PHP side that were happening closely in succession did not hit the cache because the promise of the similar query had not resolved yet. In this case, two promises were resolved, fetching the same information.
* A memory limit for the PHP process is now configurable in the package settings.

### Bugs fixed
* The status bar was not showing progress when a project index happened through a repository status change.
* Popovers will no longer go beyond the left or top part of the screen. They will move respectively right or down in that case.

### Changes for developers (see also the core)
* `getVariableTypes` has been removed as it was deprecated and just an alias for `deduceTypes`.
* The `truncate` call was removed as you can now simply call `initialize` again to reinitialize a project.
* The `deduceTypes` call now expects the (optional) entire expression to be passed rather than just its parts.
* The `reindex` call no longer automatically indexes built-in structural elements, nor will it automatically prune removed files from the database.
  * A new call, `vacuum`, can be used to vacuum a project and prune removed files from its index.
  * A new call, `initialize`, can be used to initialize a project and index built-in structural elements.
* The `reindex` call no longer takes a `progressStreamCallback`, this was necessary because it was holding back refactoring and it really did not belong there.
  * It also wasn't really useful in its current form, as the only the one doing the indexing could register a callback.
  * As a better alternative, you can now register a callback with `onDidIndexingProgress` to listen to the progress, even if you did not spawn the reindex yourself.
* A new call, `onDidStartIndexing`, has been added that allows you to listen to an indexing action starting.
* A new service method, `getCurrentProjectSettings`, allows retrieving the settings (specific to this package) of a project. This includes things such as the PHP version, paths and excluded folders.
* A new service method `getUseStatementHelper`, can be used to retrieve an object that handles adding use statements and sorting them. This has been imported from the autocompletion package so it can be reused in other packages as well (and bugfixes are centralized).
* A couple of new service methods have been added to allow fetching namespace information:
  * `getNamespaceList`
  * `getNamespaceListForFile`
  * `determineCurrentNamespaceName`
* A couple of new service methods have been added to allow fetching documentation URL's for built-in structural elements. These were imported from php-integrator-navigation so they can be reused by other packages as well:
  * `getDocumentationUrlForClass`
  * `getDocumentationUrlForFunction`
  * `getDocumentationUrlForClassMethod`
* The `resolveType` and `localizeType` commands now have a `kind` parameter that indicates what type of element te resolve. This is required as duplicate use statements may exist in PHP as long as the 'kind' is different (i.e. a `use const A\FOO` may exist alongside a `use A\FOO`).
* Built-in interfaces no longer have `isAbstract` set to true. They _are_ abstract in a certain sense, but this property is meant to indicate if a classlike has been defined using the abstract keyword. It was also not consistent with the behavior for non-built-in interfaces.
* Proxy methods will no longer throw exceptions if some parameters are missing or invalid. Instead, a promise rejection will occur.

### Note
Starting with version **2.0.0**, this repository only contains the CoffeeScript or _client_ side (for Atom) of the indexer. Most of the interesting changes are happening on the PHP or _server_ side. You can view its changelog [here](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the master branch or [here](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core/blob/development/CHANGELOG.md) for the development branch.

## 1.2.6
### Bugs fixed
* Rename the package and repository.

## 1.2.5
### Bugs fixed
* Thanks to a quick response by [danielbrodin](https://github.com/danielbrodin), all functionality related to project management should now once again be working.

## 1.2.4
### Bugs fixed
* Add workarounds for project-manager 3.0.0. Unfortunately, some functionalities are currently broken because of the backwards-incompatible upgrade. See also [this ticket](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager/issues/252) for more information.
  * Setting up new projects is currently impossible via the package, you can however still manually set up projects by adding PHP settings to their root object via the `projects.cson` file:
  ```
    php:
        enabled: true
        php_integrator:
            enabled: true
            phpVersion: 5.6
            excludedPaths: []
            fileExtensions: [
                "php"
            ]
  ```

## 1.2.3
### Bugs fixed
* Fix built-in classes with FQCN's with more than one part, such as from the MongoDB extension, not properly being indexed.

## 1.2.2
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed an error related to `JSON_PRESERVE_ZERO_FRACTION`, which needs PHP >= 5.6.

## 1.2.1
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed `exclude` warnings (thanks to [@UziTech](https://github.com/UziTech)).

## 1.2.0
### Features and enhancements
* Project support has (finally) arrived in a basic form. Unfortunately this change **needs user intervention** and will possibly break the workflow of some users:
  1. Install the [atom-project-manager](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager) package [1].
  2. Ensure that your projects are saved using `atom-project-manager`.
  3. Click `Packages â†’ PHP Integrator â†’ Set Up Current Project` (or use the command palette).
* Built-in functions and methods will now have (mostly) proper documentation and return types.
  * This is achieved by keeping an internal list of stubs of the online PHP documentation fetched using [php-doc-parser](https://github.com/martinsik/php-doc-parser).
  * Note that this will never be perfect as, even though the online documentation is much more complete than reflection, it is also not always entirely correct. For example, `DateTime::createFromFormat` can actually return `DateTime|false`, but accordiing to its online documentation signature it always returns a `DateTime`).
  * Regardless of the previous item, it will still remain a major improvement over the old reflection-only approach. Various built-in functions and methods will now properly show documentation and have proper return types, easing the pain of having to work with PHP's built-in functionality.
* Project and folder indexing performance has improved.
* `define()` statements will now be indexed much like global constants.
* Specifying the file extensions to index is now supported via project settings.
* Excluding directories from indexing is now supported via project settings, see also [the wiki](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base/wiki/Excluding-Folders-From-Indexing) for more information.
* For those interested, the wiki now [has an article](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base/wiki/Proper-Documentation-And-Type-Hinting) with information about how analysis of your code happens regarding docblocks and type hinting. Reading it may help you improve your code as well as code assistance from this package.
* The remaining parts of the analyzer that were implemented in CoffeeScript have been moved to PHP. This means the base package is now only reliant on PHP itself for processing. This may positively affect performance, but more importantly allows extracting and using the analyzer in its entirety outside Atom as well (i.e. for other editors or projects).
* Previously, ternary expressions could only be properly analyzed if they had the same return type:

```php
$a1 = new A();
$a2 = new A();

$a3 = some_condition() ? $a1 : $a2;

// $a3 is now an 'A' because both conditions yield the same type.
```

This restriction has now been lifted. Using ternary operators with conditions resulting in different types will now simply yield multiple return types:

```php
$a = new A();
$b = new B();

$c = some_condition() ? $a : $b;

// $c is now of type A|B.
```

* The default value for classlike properties and constants is now used for type deduction. This will improve type guessing in several situations. For example, when generating a docblock for `$foo`:

```php
// Before:

    /**
     * @var mixed
     */
    protected $foo = 'test';

// After:

    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $foo = 'test';

```

### Bugs fixed
* The return type of global functions was being ignored if they had multiple return types.
* In rare cases, caching would complain that it could not create the `accessing_shared_cache.lock` file.
* When force indexing, the cache was not properly invalidated, sometimes leading to the wrong data being fetched.
* Retrieving locally available variables wasn't always using the most up to date version of the editor's contents.
* Fix an empty error message and notification sometimes being shown in Atom because the PHP side was incorrectly parsing docblocks containing Unicode characters.
* When retrieving available variables or deducing types, character offsets were not correctly being translated to byte offsets, sometimes leading to incorrect results.

### Changes for developers
* `getInvocationInfo` is now also available separately as PHP command.
* Constants and properties will now also return their default values, if present.
* `determineCurrentClassName` was not causing a promise rejection when fetching the class list failed internally.
* A new command `truncate` now does what a force reindex does, but also ensures the cache is properly invalidated.
* `getInvocationInfoAt` will now return an `offset` rather than a `bufferPosition` to be consistent with the other commands.
* `getResultingTypesAt` is now simply a convenience call to `deduceTypes` as its underlying code has been completely moved to PHP.
* `deduceTypes` gained a new parameter `ignoreLastElement`, which does the same as the identically-named parameter for `getResultingTypesAt` does.

### Notes
[1] Why `atom-project-manager`? The truth is that I would have preferred not to select any specific third-party package for project support so users can use the package they prefer. Users familiar with the project discussions will remember that I have long postponed this change for this reason. Unfortunately, as nothing seems to change and project support is feeling more and more like a missing feature, I decided to go ahead and link to the most popular project management package currently out there. `atom-project-manager` also supports other generic project settings in its CSON file, which leaves room for other Atom packages to also save settings to the same file in harmony with this one. In the future, someone could even develop a GUI for managing project settings.

## 1.1.2
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed grouped use statements never being seen as unused.
* Fixed grouped use statements being marked as unknown classes.
* Fixed grouped use statements being ignored for type resolution when indexing.
* Files that do not have UTF-8 encoding will be converted before they are indexed.

## 1.1.1
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the various `codeCoverageIgnore` tags from PHPUnit being seen as invalid tags (thanks to [@hultberg](https://github.com/hultberg)).

## 1.1.0
### Features and enhancements
* Caching performance has been improved.
* Added simple support for multiple root folders in the tree view.
* At least PHP 5.5 is now required to run the service. PHP 5.4 has been declared end of life for quite some time now and 5.5 will be declared end of life 10 July 2016. This does not affect the code you can actually write, the indexer still supports PHP 5.2 up to PHP 7.0, it is just the PHP interpreter running the indexer that had a required version bump.
* Some commands delegate work to other commands, but each command that requires parsing performed its own parsing of the (same) source code, even though it only needs to happen once. This unnecessary overhead has been removed, resulting in performance improvements across the board.
* The strictness on `instanceof` has been lifted. The variable type deducer is now able to parse somewhat more complex if statements:

```php
if ((1 ^ 0) && true && $b instanceof B && ($test || false && true)) {
    // $b will now be recognized as an instance of B.
}
```

* If-statements containing variable handling functions such as `is_string`, `is_bool` will now influence type deduction:

```php
if (is_string($b) || is_array($b)) {
    // $b is now of type string|array.
}
```

### Bugs fixed
* The PHP Mess Detector `@SuppressWarnings` docblock tag will no longer be linted as unknown tag.
* Different projects weren't using different caches. This means that in some cases the wrong cache was being used.
* In some cases, the internal cache wasn't cleared when a class was modified, which resulted in old data being displayed.
* Text following the `@var` tag in docblocks for class constants will now serve as short descriptions (summaries), similar to class properties.
* Some internal PHP classes, such as `COM` have inconsistent naming (i.e. `COM` is actually returned as being named `com`). These are now corrected during indexing so you can use the names from the documentation. (For PHP this isn't a problem as it is mostly case insensitive, but we are.)
* *Caching has been reenabled on Windows*, a fix has been applied that should refrain errors from popping up. The cache will simply reset itself if it runs into the erroneous condition (the reason behind which, up this date, is still unknown to me). This way, users are still able to enjoy some caching (users that did not experience any problems at all previously will be able to enjoy full caching).

### Changes for developers
* Builtin functions did not have a FQCN set.
* Added `deduceTypesAt` as a convenience alias.
* The global function and constant list will now return a mapping of FQCN's to data (instead of names to data).
* `semanticLint` learned how to validate unknown class members, global functions and global constants, which can be used by linter packages.
* The path passed to handlers registered using `onDidFinishIndexing` and `onDidFailIndexing` will now be an array for project indexes (but not file indexes) as they can contain multiple root folders.
* `getVariableTypes` is now deprecated as it is just an alias for calling `deduceTypes` and `deduceTypes` with the variable name as the sole part. It will now also just proxy calls to deduceTypes internally.

## 1.0.10
### Bugs fixed
* Cleaned up the reindexing process. The locks that were causing so much trouble have been removed for now.
  * It was originally added as multiple concurrent indexing processes locked the database to ensure the other processes wait their turn. However, testing this again without it seems to indicate SQLite (automatically) gracefully waits for the transaction to finish. Either they accidentally solved the original problem, or the original problem might only manifest in certain circumstances. If the problem reappears anyway, I will investigate alternative solutions.

## 1.0.9
### Bugs fixed
* An error is now returned if a file is not in UTF-8 encoding.
* The encoding is now explicitly set to UTF-8, in case the encoding in your php.ini is set to something else.

## 1.0.8
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the database file never getting unlocked if indexing failed.

## 1.0.7
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the `setCachePrefix` error on Windows.

## 1.0.6
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed docblock correctness linting going haywire when there were unicode characters inside the docblock.
* The caching fix from 1.0.5 was rolled back because it didn't work. Caching has been disabled on Windows until a solution can be found.
* Fixed words after an `@` symbol in docblocks incorrectly being marked as unknown annotation class (e.g. `@author Someone <someone@test.com>`).

## 1.0.5
### Bugs fixed
* Attempt to fix the cache permission denied issue on Windows by using a different caching directory.

## 1.0.4
### Bugs fixed
* Byte and character offsets were being mixed up. The expected formats have been documented in the README:
  * Output offsets retrieved from the service (and PHP side) have always been byte offsets, and this will also remain the same. To deal with the conversion, a new service method, `getCharacterOffsetFromByteOffset`, has been added.
  * The PHP side expects byte offsets, but commands that need offsets also gained an option `charoffset` to switch to pass character offsets instead. The CoffeeScript side has always expected character offsets as input because Atom mainly works with these, and this will remain the same.
  * In short, nothing has changed for dependent packages, but packages that use byte offsets incorrectly as character offsets may want to use the new service method to perform the conversion.

## 1.0.3
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed namespaces without a name causing an error when resolving types.

## 1.0.2
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a circular dependency exception being thrown if a classlike implemented the same interface twice via separate paths.
* If you have the same FQCN twice in your code base, only one of them will be analyzed when examining classlikes for associations (parents, traits, interfaces, ...). Having two classes with the same FQCN is actually an error, but it can happen if you store files that aren't actually directly part of your code inside your project folder. A better solution for this is to exclude those folders from indexing, which will be possible as soon as project support is implemented. Until that happens, this should mitigate the circular dependency exception that ensued because two classlikes with the same name were examined.

## 1.0.1
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed error regarding `$type` when not using PHP 7 (thanks to [@UziTech](https://github.com/UziTech)).

## 1.0.0
### Features and enhancements
* Minor performance improvements when calculating the global class list.
* Annotation tags in docblocks will now be subject to unknown class examination.
* A caching layer was introduced that will drastically cut down on time needed to calculate information about structures. This information is used almost everywhere throughout the code so an increase in responsiveness should be noticable across the board. This will especially be the case in complex classes that have many dependencies. The cache files will be stored in your system's temporary folder so they will get recycled automatically when necessary.
* Type deduction learned how to deal with ternary expressions where both operands have the same resulting type:

```php
$a1 = new A();
$a2 = new A();

$a = true ? $a1 : $a2;

$a-> // Did not work before. Will now autocomplete A, as the type is guaranteed.

$b1 = new B();
$b2 = new \B();

$b = $b1 ?: $b2;

$b-> // Did not work before. Will now autocomplete B, for the same reasons.
```

* Type deduction learned how to deal with ternary expressions containing instanceof:

```php
$a = ($foo instanceof Foo) ? $foo-> // Will now autocomplete Foo.
```

### Bugs fixed
* The type of global built-in function parameters was not getting analyzed correctly.
* Built-in functions that have invalid UTF-8 characters in their name are now ignored.
* Fixed docblock tags containing an @ sign in their description being incorrectly parsed.
* Docblock types did not always get precedence over type hints of function or method parameters.
* Use statements are no longer marked as unused if they are used inside docblocks as annotation.
* Parameters that have the type `self` (in docblock or type hint), `static` or `$this` (in docblock) will now correctly be examined.
* Don't freeze up until the call stack overflows when classes try to implement themselves (as interface) or use themselves (as trait).
* Foreach statements that contain a list() expression as value will no longer cause an error (e.g. `foreach ($array as list($a, $b)) { ... }`).
* Type localization didn't work properly for classlikes that were in the same namespace as the active one. For example, in namespace `A`, type `\A\B` would be localized to `A\B` instead of just `B`.
* Fixed a classlike suddenly no longer being found if you defined another classlike with the same FQCN in another file (i.e. after copying a file). This happened, most annoyingly, even if you then changed the FQCN in the copied file, and couldn't be fixed without reindexing the original file.
* Static method calls where the class name had a leading slash were not being examined correctly:

```php
$foo = \Foo\Bar::method();
$foo-> // Didn't work, should work now.
```

* Type overrides with multiple types were not analyzed properly:

```php
/** @var Foo|null $foo */
$foo-> // Did not work, should work now.
```

* Fix call stacks not correctly being retrieved after the new keyword, for example:

```php
$test = new $this-> // Was seen as "new $this" rather than just "$this".
```

* Fix overridden or implemented methods with different parameter lists losing information about their changed parameter list. Whenever such a method now specifies different parameters than the "parent" method, parameters are no longer inherited and a docblock should be specified to document them.

```php
class A
{
    /**
     * @param Foo $foo
     */
    public function __construct($foo) { ... }
}

class B extends A
{
    // Previously, these two parameters would get overwritten and the parameter list would be
    // just "$foo" as the parent documentation is inherited.
    public function __construct($bar, $test) { ... }
}
```

* Conditionals with instanceof in them will now no longer be examined outside their scope:

```php
if ($foo instanceof Foo) {
    $foo-> // Autocompletion for Foo as before.
}

$foo-> // Worked before, now no longer works.
```

* More elaborate inline docblocks with type annotations will now also be parsed:

```php
/**
 * Some documentation.
 *
 * @var D $d A description.
 */
$d = 5;
$d-> // Didn't work because a docblock spanning multiple lines was not examined, should work now.
```

* Compound class property statements now properly have their docblocks examined:

```php
/**
 * This is the summary.
 *
 * This is a long description.
 *
 * @var Foo1 $testProperty1 A description of the first property.
 * @var Foo2 $testProperty2 A description of the second property.
 */
protected $testProperty1, $testProperty2;
```

* In property docblocks with ambiguous summary and `@var` descriptions, the more specific `@var` will now take precedence. This more neatly fits in with the compound statements described above:

```php
/**
 * This is the docblock summary, it will not be used or available anywhere as it is overridden below.
 *
 * This is a long description. It will be used as long description for all of the properties described below.
 *
 * @var Foo1 $testProperty1 A description of the first property. This will be used as the summary of this property.
 */
protected $testProperty1;
```

### Changes for developers
* All structural elements that involve types will now return arrays of type objects instead of a single type object. The following methods have been renamed to reflect this change:
  * `deduceType` -> `deduceTypes`.
  * `getVariableType` -> `getVariableTypes`.
  * `getResultingTypeAt` -> `getResultingTypesAt`.
  * `getVariableTypeByOffset` -> `getVariableTypesByOffset`.
* An `isFinal` property is now returned for classes and methods.
* An `isNullable` property is now returned for function and method parameters.
* A `defaultValue` property is now returned for function and method parameters with the default value in string format.
* `resolveType` will now also return types with a leading slash, consistent with other commands.
* Return types for functions and types for function parameters will now also include a `typeHint` property that is set to the actual type hint that was specified (the type and resolvedType fall back to the docblock if it is present).
* `localizeType` will now return the FQCN instead of null if it couldn't localize a type based on use statements. The reasoning behind this is that you want a localized version of the type you pass, if there are no use statements to localize it, the FQCN is the only way to address the type locally.
* The format the descriptions are returned in has changed; there is no more `descriptions` property that has a `short` and `long` property. Instead, there is now the `shortDescription` and `longDescription` property. Similarly, the description of the return value of functions and methods has moved to `returnDescription` and the description of the type of properties and constants to `typeDescription`.

## 0.9.5
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the database handle being opened in an incorrect way.

## 0.9.4
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the database handle never being closed after it was opened.

## 0.9.3
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed variables nclosure use statements not having their type resolved properly in some corner cases.

## 0.9.2
### Bugs fixed
* (Attempt to) fix indexing for built-in classes returning malformed method parameters.

## 0.9.1
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed variables used in closure use statements not having their type resolved from the parent scope, for example:

```php
$a = new B();

$closure = new function () use ($a) {
    $a-> // Now correctly resolves to 'B' instead of not working at all.
};
```

## 0.9.0
### Features and enhancements
* An error will now be shown if your SQLite version is out of date.
* Unknown classes in docblocks will now actually be underlined instead of the structural element they were part of.
* Indexing performance has been improved, especially the scanning phase (before the progress bar actually started filling) has been improved.
* Indexing is now more fault-tolerant: in some cases, indexing will still be able to complete even if there are syntax errors in the file.
* Docblock types now take precedence over type hints. The reason for this is that docblock types are optional and they can be more specific. Take for example, the fluent interface for setters, PHP does not allow specifying `static` or `$this` as a return type using scalar type hinting, but you may still want to automatically resolve to child classes when the setter is inherited:

```php
/**
 * @return static
 */
public function setFoo(string $foo): self
{

}
```

### Bugs fixed
* The return type of PHP 7 methods was not properly used as fallback.
* If you (incorrectly) declare or define the same member twice in a class, one of them will now no longer be picked up as an override.
* The `@inheritDoc` syntax without curly braces wasn't always correctly being handled, resulting in docblocks containing only them still being treated as actual docblocks that weren't inherited.

### Changes for developers
* Semantic linting can now lint docblock correctness.
* Semantic linting will now also return syntax errors.
* Support for calling most methods synchronously has been removed.
* Classes didn't return information about whether they have a docblock or documentation.
* When fetching class information, types were sometimes returned without their leading slash.
* Because of semantic linting now supporting syntax errors, the reindex command will no longer return them.
* Global constants and functions will now also return an FQCN so you can deduce in what namespace they are located.
* When returning types such as `string[]`, the `fullType` was still trying to resolve the type as if it were a class type.
* The reindex command did not return false when indexing failed and the promise was, by consequence, not rejected.
* Added a new command `localizeType` to localize FQCN's based on use statements, turning them back into relative class names.
* The `semanticLint` method now takes an `options` object that allows you to disable certain parts of the linting process.
* Classes will now return information about whether they are usable as annotation or not (determined by an `@Annotation` tag in their docblock). This is non-standard, but is becoming more and more commonly used in the PHP world (e.g. Symfony and Doctrine).

## 0.8.2
### Bugs fixed
* Circular dependencies should no longer freeze but show an error notification instead.
* Fixed the argument index (used by the call tips package) not being correct for function calls containing SQL strings.

## 0.8.1
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed infinite loop occurring when assigning variables to an expression containing themselves.

## 0.8.0
### Features and enhancements
* Some internal logic has been rewritten to support working asynchronously. The existing list of packages have already been adjusted to make use of this change, which will improve apparant responsiveness across the board.
* Memory-mapped I/O is now enabled on the SQLite back end on systems that support it. This can drastically improve performance and latency of some queries. (In a local test with a large codebase, this literally halved a large class information fetch from 250 milliseconds down to 125 milliseconds).
* A project index will now be triggered when the repository (if present) changes statusses. This isn't as aggressive as a file monitor, but will at least remove the annoyance of having to manually rescan when checking out a different branch to avoid incorrect data being served. Events that will trigger this involve:
  * Doing a checkout to switch to a different branch.
  * Modifying a file from the project tree externally and then coming back to Atom.

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed PHP 7 anonymous classes still being parsed.
* Fixed a rare error relating to an "undefined progressStreamCallback".
* Fixed arrays of class names (e.g. `Foo[]`) in docblocks not being semantically linted.
* Fixed `getInvocationInfoAt` incorrectly walking past control keywords such as `elseif`.

### Changes for developers
* Almost all service methods now have an async parameter. It is recommended that you always use this functionality as it will ensure the editor remains responsive for the end user. In a future release, support for synchronous calls **will _probably_ be removed**.
* A new method `deduceType` has been added.
* A new method `getVariableTypeByOffset` has been added.
* `getVariableType`, `getResultingTypeAt`, `resolveTypeAt` and `getInvocationInfoAt` have received an additional parameter, `async`, that will make them (mostly) asynchronous.
* `getVariableType` and `getResultingTypeAt` have been rewritten in PHP. Class types returned by these methods will now _always_ be absolute and _always_ include a leading slash. Previously the returned type was _sometimes_ relative to the current file and _sometimes_ absolute. To make things worse, absolute types _sometimes_ contained a leading slash, leading to confusion. (Scalar types will still not include a leading slash.)
* A new property `hasDocumentation` is now returned for items already having the `hasDocblock` property. The latter will still return false if the docblock is inherited from the parent, but the former will return true in that case.
* The following methods have been removed, they were barely used and just provided very thin wrappers over existing functionality:
  * `getClassMember`
  * `getClassMemberAt`
  * `getClassConstant`
  * `getClassConstantAt`
  * `getClassMethod`
  * `getClassMethodAt`
  * `getClassProperty`
  * `getClassPropertyAt`
  * `getClassSelectorFromEvent` (didn't really belong in the base package).

## 0.7.2
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed minor error where the service version was bumped incorrectly.

## 0.7.1
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed semantic linting not marking use statements in docblocks as used when their types were used inside a type union (e.g. `string|DateTime`).
* Fixed semantic linting not checking if class names in docblocks existed when they occurred inside a type union (e.g. `string|DateTime`).
* Fixed semantic linting not validating class names that were used inside function calls or in class constant fetching.
* Fixed semantic linting marking use statements as unused whilst they were being used inside function calls or in class constant fetching.

### Changes for developers
* Methods will now contain information about whether they are abstract or not.
* Methods will now contain information about whether the method they override was abstract or not.

## 0.7.0
### Features and enhancements
* The SQLite database will now use the WAL journal mode, which offers performance benefits. (See also [the SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/draft/wal.html) for those interested.)
* Additional checks have been added to ensure the indexing database doesn't go into an invalid state.
* The use of `{@inheritDoc}` to extend long descriptions will now also work for child classes and extending interfaces.
* Indexing will now respond less aggressively to changes in the buffer. Instead of spawning an indexing process unconditionally each time a file stops changing (after a couple hundred milliseconds by default), an indexing process will now only be spawned as soon as the previous one finishes. In essence, if an indexing process is already running, the indexer holds on to the changes and issues a reindex as soon as the previous one finishes. If a file takes very long to index and at this point you make multiple changes to the same file, only the last version will be reindexed (i.e. reindexing actions are not actually queued and the indexer does not need to catch up on a possibly long list of changes).

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed some parameters of magic methods not showing up at all.
* Fixed event handlers not being disposed when the package was deactivated.
* Fixed parameter names for magic methods containing a comma in some cases.
* Fixed parameters for magic methods being incorrectly marked as being optional.
* Return types for magic properties were not being fetched at all.
* Fixed problems with paths containing spaces on anything non-Windows (Linux, Mac OS X, ...).
* Fixed the indexing progress bar disappearing sometimes if you edited a file while it was busy.
* Fixed the `Warning: is_dir(): Unable to find the wrapper "atom"` error showing up in rare cases.
* Fixed call stacks of simple expressions interpolated inside strings not being correctly retrieved.
* Return types for magic methods were not being resolved relative to use statements or the namespace.
* Parameter names for magic methods no longer contain a dollar sign (consistent with everything else).
* Always set the timezone to UTC. (I changed my mind about this, due to reasons listed in [PR #129](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base/pull/129).) (thanks to [@tillkruss](https://github.com/tillkruss)).
* Fixed issues with the indexer not correctly dealing with class names starting with a lower case letter.
* Some non-standard behavior has been removed that may or may not be noticable to users:
  * Constants in traits will no longer be picked up (PHP error).
  * Properties in traits will no longer be scanned for aliases (PHP error).
  * Properties inside interfaces will not be "inherited" anymore (PHP error).

### Changes for developers
* Magic properties and methods will no longer return true for `hasDocblock`.
* `getAvailableVariables` received an extra (optional) `async` parameter.
* `determineCurrentClassName` received an extra (optional) `async` parameter.
* Magic properties and methods now return the class start line as their end line.
* A new method `semanticLint` is now available that can semantically lint files and return various issues with it.
* A new method `getAvailableVariablesByOffset` has been added that allows fetching available variables via an offset in a file. This method is implemented in PHP, supports asynchronous operation and the existing `getAvailableVariables` has been rewritten to use this method.

## 0.6.10
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the type resolver (--resolve-type) returning types prefixed with a leading slash when a file had no namespace, which is unnecessary and confusing as this slash isn't prepended anywhere else.

## 0.6.9
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed built-in functions not being marked as being built-in.
* Fixed the "Oops, something went wrong!" message when opening a comment that encompassed the rest of the file.

## 0.6.8
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed no internal namespace record being generated when there were no use statements nor a namespace in a file (resulting in notifications being shown relating to no namespace being found).

## 0.6.7
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed incorrect array key being used (`Undefined index: end_line`).
* Notices and warnings from the PHP side will now be shown in the error notification.
* Error reporting is now enabled explicitly in case you have it disabled on a global scale so you can see what is going wrong in the Atom error notification (without having to manually debug it).

## 0.6.6
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed compatibility with PHP < 5.6 by avoiding use of ARRAY_FILTER_USE_KEY.

## 0.6.5
### Bugs fixed
* Reintroduced the xdebug max nesting level, but this time set it to a ridiculously large number for compatibility.

## 0.6.4
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a minor logic error.

## 0.6.3
### Bugs fixed
* Don't treat invalid JSON output as a JavaScript error, as it's usually not a bug in our package. Just display an error to the user instead.

## 0.6.2
### Bugs fixed
* The "Indexing failed!" message has disappeared. If you wish to know when the indexer is having problems, consider using the new linter package (see also the README).

## 0.6.1
### Bugs fixed
* Removed the dependency on fuzzaldrin.
* Fixed the type of new instances, wrapped in parentheses and spread over several lines, not being properly recognized:

```php
// Works:
(new \IteratorIterator)->

// Fails (fixed):
(new \IteratorIterator(

))->
```

## 0.6.0
### Features and enhancements
* xdebug will now be disabled in the indexer if it is present, it will only slow down the indexer.
* Support for type inference when using the `clone` keyword, for example:

```php
$a = new \DateTime();
$b = clone $a;
$b-> // Autocompletion for DateTime.
```

* The draft PSR-5's `@inheritDoc` is now supported to indicate documentation was not forgotten. Also, note the difference with the non-standard ("incorrect"), yet commonly used, curly brace syntax used by Symfony 2 and other frameworks (which is also supported).

```php
/**
 * @inheritDoc
 */
public function explicitInheritanceAccordingToDraftPsr5()
{
    ...
}

/**
 * {@inheritDoc}
 */
public function incorrectInheritanceButCommonlyUsed()
{
    ...
}
```

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed autocompletion not working after the concatenation operator.
* Fixed author tags that contained mail addresses (such as used in Symfony) being taken up in extended descriptions.
* Fixed an incorrect parameter index being returned in cases where you had array access via keys in function or method invocations.
* Fixed a database constraint error when indexing parameters, which can happen if you have certain PHP extensions enabled (I'm looking at you, ssh2).
* Resolving types is now more correct, taking multiple namespaces per file into account as well as only utilizing use statements that actually apply for a specific line.

### Changes for developers
* A new call `getClassListForFile` takes a file path to filter the class list by.
* `getClassSelectorFromEvent` will no longer return null for built-in classes (you can still easily check this yourself).
* Next to `startLine` information, `endLine` information will now also be returned.
* Fetching class information will now also return information about direct and indirect implemented interfaces and used traits via the properties `parents`, `directParents`, `interfaces`, `directInterfaces`, `traits` and `directTraits`.
* Fetching class information will now also return information about direct children, direct implementors (if it's an interface) and direct users (if it's a trait).
* `determineFullClassName` was split up into two methods (separation of concerns):
  * `determineCurrentClassName` - Takes an editor and a buffer position and returns the FQCN of the class the location is in. The buffer position is now required as a file can contain multiple classes, which were not retrievable before.
  * `resolveType` (with accompanying convenience method `resolveTypeAt`) - Takes an editor, a line, and a type name and resolves that type to its FQCN based on local use statements and namespace rules.

## 0.5.4
### Features and enhancements
* Better error reporting. Exceptions thrown by the PHP side will now be displayed in an Atom error.

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed `getInvocationInfoAt` not giving correct results when inside an argument that was wrapped in parentheses.
* Fixed `getInvocationInfoAt` not giving a correct argument index when inside an array parameter with square brackets.

## 0.5.3
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed expressions inside ternary operators not correctly being fetched.

## 0.5.2
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed an error being thrown when writing code in a PHP file that hadn't been saved yet.

## 0.5.1
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed classes never being marked as being abstract.

## 0.5.0
### Features and enhancements
* Minor performance improvements when resolving local class names from docblocks.
* Indexing will now happen continuously (onDidStopChanging of the text buffer) instead of only on save.
* Descriptions from base classes or base interfaces will now be inherited if no description is present for a child class.
* Type inference has been added for arrays, e.g.:

```php
/** @var Foo[] $list */
foreach ($list as $item) {
    $item-> // Autocompletion will be provided for 'Foo'.
}
```

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed docblocks with an empty throws tag causing the indexer to fail (Filter/Encrypt/Mcrypt.php in Zend 1 has one of these, apparently).
* Fixed types not being properly inferred with the new keyword in combination with keywords such as `self`, `static` and `parent`, e.g. `$foo = new static();`.
* Fixed issues with retrieving types in call stacks including static access, such as `self::$property->foo`.
* Fixed built-in methods and functions having class types as parameters not being properly indexed. Instead, a PHP object would be returned in the parameter list. (Only applies to PHP 7.)
* Fixed paths with spaces not indexing properly on Windows. (thanks to [@dipyalov](https://github.com/dipyalov))
* Fixed variables being assigned to an expression on themselves sometimes not having their correct type deduced, for example:

```php
$foo = new Foo();
$foo = $foo-> // The cursor is here.

moreCode();

// The type would now be based on "$foo = $foo->moreCode()" instead of on "$foo = new Foo()".
```

### Changes for developers
* Popovers will, by default, no longer catch pointer events (making them click-through).
* You can now listen to indexing succeeding or failing using `onDidFinishIndexing` and `onDidFailIndexing`. (thanks to [@tocjent](https://github.com/tocjent))
* The type for parameters of methods will now return the type as it was found in the file. If you wish to access the full resolved class type, you can use the new `fullType` property instead.
* A new method `getInvocationInfoAt` is now available that allows fetching information about the function or method being invoked at the specified cursor position in an editor.

## 0.4.9
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the type of function or method parameters that were not documented incorrectly being set to the type of `$this`.

## 0.4.8
### Bugs fixed
* The command names in the command palette will now be separated by spaces.
* The indexer will no longer show warnings when `file_get_contents` fails. This will be caught and a warning will be displayed in verbose mode instead, ensuring that it will no longer cause indexing to fail in its entirety.
* Fixed interfaces extending multiple other interfaces only having the first parent interface examined. This resulted in some class members not being listed if you implemented such an interface and could also result in files being scanned in the incorrect order (i.e. a child interface before a parent interface). This also resulted in a minor performance increase when fetching class information regarding inheritance as less queries are performed.

## 0.4.7
### Bugs fixed
* Bump the database version.

## 0.4.6
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed types sometimes showing up as [Object object] because the indexer was incorrectly saving an object instead of a string type.
* Fixed built-in functions not having an empty array serialized to the throws_serialized field, resulting in warnings when iterating over them, which in turn caused problems on the CoffeeScript side.

## 0.4.5
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed magic properties ending up in the index with a dollar sign in their name.
* Fixed built-in class constants being indexed by value instead of name. This also resulted in a constraint error in the database. (thanks to [@tocjent](https://github.com/tocjent))

## 0.4.4
### Bugs fixed
* Do not try to index structural elements that do not have a namespaced name, which can happen for anonymous PHP 7 classes.

## 0.4.3
### Bugs fixed
* Disable the xdebug nesting limit by setting it to -1, which was posing problems when resolving names.

## 0.4.2
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the `indexes` folder not automatically being created.

## 0.4.1
### Bugs fixed
* Removed the 'old version' note from the README.

## 0.4.0
### Features and enhancements
* The PHP side now no longer uses Reflection, but a php-parser-based incremental indexer. This has the following advantages:
  * Composer is no longer required.
  * Autoloading is no longer required.
  * Multiple structural elements (classes) in a file will correctly end up in the index.
  * Parsing is inherently more correct, no more misbehaving corner cases or regex-based parsing.
  * Incremental indexing, no more composer classmap dumping on startup and a long indexing process.
  * Paves the road for the future more detailed parsing, analyzing and better performance. (As a side-effect, the PHP side can also be used for other editors than Atom.)
  * The package still requires PHP >= 5.4, but the code you're writing can be anything that php-parser 2 supports, which is currently PHP >= 5.2 up to (and including) PHP 7. Note that the CoffeeScript side has not changed and also does some regex-based parsing, which may still lack some functionality (especially with relation to PHP 7).

* Made it possible to make magic members static. This is not documented in phpDocumentor's documentation, but useful and also used by PHPStorm:

```php
/**
 * @method static void foo()
 * @property static Foo $test
 */
class Foo
{
    ...
}
```

* Added menu items for some commands.
* The progress bar will now actually show progress, which is useful for large projects.
* There is now a command available in the command palette to reindex your project (thanks to [@wcatron](https://github.com/wcatron)).
* Similarly, there is now also a command available to forcibly reindex the project (i.e. remove the entire database first).

### Bugs fixed
* A progress bar will no longer be shown for windows opened without a project.
* Methods returning `static` were not properly resolving to the current class if they were not overridden (they were resolving to the closest parent class that defined them).
* Project and file paths that contain spaces should no longer pose a problem (thanks to [@wcatron](https://github.com/wcatron)).

### Changes for developers
* Constants and class properties will now retrieve their start line as well. These items not being available was previously manually worked around in the php-integrator-navigation package. This manual workaround is now present in the base package as CoffeeScript should not have to bend itself backwards to get this information because PHP Reflection didn't offer it.
* `declaringStructure` will now also contain a `startLineMember` property that indicates the start line of the member in the structural element.
* Retrieving types for the list of local variables has been disabled for now as the performance impact is too large in longer functions. It may be reactivated in a future release.
* Constructor information is no longer retrieved when fetching the class list as the performance hit is too large. In fact, this was also the case before the new indexer, but then a cache file was used, which was never properly updated with new classes and was the result of the very long indexing process at start-up.
* `deprecated` was renamed to `isDeprecated` for consistency.
* `wasFound` was removed when fetching class (structural element) information as a failure status is now returned instead.
* `class` was removed when fetching class (structural element) information as this information is already available in the `name` property.
* `isMethod` and `isProperty` were removed as they are no longer necessary since members are now in separate associative arrays.
* Added the more specific convenience methods `getClassMethodAt`, `getClassPropertyAt` and `getClassConstantAt`.
* `isTrait`, `isInterface` and `isClass` were replaced with a single string `type` property.
* Functions and methods no longer return a separate `parameters` and `optionals` property. The two have now been merged and provide more information (such as whether the parameters are a reference, variadic, optional, ...).

## 0.3.1
### Bugs fixed
* Fixed methods returning `static`, `self` or `$this` not properly having their full type deduced.
* Fixed inline type override annotations not being able to contain descriptions (e.g. `/** @var Class $foo Some description. */`).

## 0.3.0
### Features and enhancements
* Performance in general should be improved as the same parsing operations are now cached as often as possible.
* Types of variables that are assigned to basic type expressions will now be deduced properly instead of just having the expression as type:

```php
$var = 5;    // $var = int
$var = 5.0;  // $var = float
$var = true; // $var = bool
$var = "";   // $var = string
$var = [];   // $var = array
```

* If statements that have (only) an 'instanceof' of a variable in them will now be used to deduce the type of a variable. (More complex if statements will, at least for now, not be picked up.) For example (when using php-integrator-autocomplete-plus):

```php
if ($foo instanceof Foo) {
    $foo-> // Autocompletion for Foo will be shown.
}
```

* Closures will now be detected, for example (when using php-integrator-autocomplete-plus):

```php
$foo = function () {

};

$foo-> // Autocompletion for Closure, listing bind and bindTo.
```

* Added support for parsing magic properties and methods for classes, which will now also be returned (property-read and property-write are also returned):

```php
/**
 * @property Foo $someProperty A description.
 * @method magicFoo($param1, array $param2 = null) My magic method.
 */
class MyClass
{

}
```

### Bugs fixed
* The indexer will no longer try to index PHP files that don't belong to the project on save.
* Docblock parameters weren't being analyzed for deducing the type of local variables when in a global function.
* Types of variables that had their assigned values spread over multiple lines will now correctly have their type deduced.
* In rare cases, types could not be properly deduced, such as in `$a = ['b' => (new Foo())->]` (`Foo` would incorrectly not be returned as type).
* Only the relevant scopes will now be searched for the type of variables, previously all code was examined, even code outside the current scope.
* Descriptions after the `@var` tag, i.e. `@var Foo $foo My description` , will now be used as fall back when there is no short description present.
* The wrong type was sometimes shown for variables as their type was determined at the point they were found instead of the point at which they were requested.
* Functions that had no docblock were wrongly assumed to return 'void' (or 'self' in the case of constructors). This only applies to functions that do have a docblock, but no `@return` tag in the docblock.
* Support for the short annotation style, `/** @var FooClass */`, was dropped. The reason for this is that it's not supported by any IDE and is very specific to this package. It's also completely inflexible because it needs to be directly above the last assignment or other type deduction (such as a catch block) for it to be picked up incorrectly. The other annotation styles have none of these restrictions and also work in IDE's such as PHPStorm.

### Changes for developers
* `determineFullClassName` will now return basic types as is, without prefixing them with the current namespace.
* A new method `isBasicType` has been introduced, that will return true for basic types such as "int", "BOOL", "array", "string", ...
* The `getDocParams` method has been removed. It was obsolete as the same information is already returned by `getClassInfo`. Also more caches can be reused by using `getClassInfo`.
* The `autocomplete` method has been removed. It was confusing and also mostly obsolete as its functionality can already be mimicked through other methods (it was only internally used).
* Data returned about methods, constants, functions and structures will no longer have an 'args' property containing information such as descriptions. Instead these were moved up one level (in other words you can just replace the `.args.property` with just `.property` everywhere). It wasn't clear what exactly belonged in `args` and what didn't, hence its entire removal.

## 0.2.0
### Features and enhancements
* There was no convenient visual indicator of when indexing failed, a label is now shown in the status bar if that is indeed the case.
* When the initial PHP process that indexes the entire project fails or is killed, it will now be picked up and displayed as an error.
* The list of variables returned will now try to skip scopes that don't apply. For example, you will now only see variables that are relevant to your closure when inside one.
* It is now possible to specify a list of additional scripts to load, which allows you to add things such as bootstrap scripts or scripts with global helper functions, which will then be made available to other packages (such as autocompletion).
* The return type of your global functions will now be correctly analyzed, the following will now work:

```php
/**
 * @return \DateTime
 */
function foo()
{

}

foo()-> // Autocompletion for DateTime.
```

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed the 'className.split is not a function' error popping up sometimes.
* Fixed type hints from function parameters not being correctly deduced in some cases.
* Return values such as `\DateTime` (with a leading slash) were not always being found.
* Numbers and underscores were not permitted in class names in several locations (they are now).
* The PHP FileParser will no longer trip over class docblocks containing the pattern `class MyClass`.
* Classes from this package are now no longer included in the class list and will no longer be indexed.
* Fix several issues with autocompletion of `(new Foo())->` in corner cases such as inside arrays and function calls.
* Global class names in combination with the 'new' operator such as `new \My\Class` were not properly having their type deduced (and e.g. getting no autocompletion as a result).
* Fixed an issue where the package would attempt to index the project on shutdown. This could result in a message being displayed at shutdown about the Atom window not being responsive.

### Changes for developers
* New service methods:
  * `getClassMethod` - Retrieves information about a specific class method.
  * `getClassProperty` - Retrieves information about a specific class property.
  * `getClassConstant` - Retrieves information about a specific class constant.
* Previously, `getCalledClass` always ignored the last element in a call stack, causing `$this->foo->b` to return the type of `foo` instead of `b`. Because this behavior is unexpected and undocumented, this no longer happens. To maintain this 'feature', a new parameter `ignoreLastElement` has been added that can be set to true to restore this behavior (i.e. it will return the type of `foo`). Setting it to false will return the type of `b` instead.
* `getGlobalFunctions` will now also return user-defined global functions (i.e. non-internal global functions).
* `getGlobalConstants` will now also return information about if a constant is built-in or not (as opposed to user defined).
* `getAvailableVariables` now returns an object with variable names mapped to information such as their type (if found).
* `getClassMemberAt` will now return the correct member if a structure has a property and a method with the same name.
* `getCalledClass` is now called `getResultingTypeAt` to better indicate what it does and that it needs a buffer position.
* Class constants will now contain information about their declaring class and declaring structure, just like other members.
* Several methods such as `getClassInfo` now take an additional parameter to make them execute asynchronously (a promise will be returned instead of the actual results).

## 0.1.0
* Initial release.
