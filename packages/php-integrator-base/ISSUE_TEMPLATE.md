Whoa, there! Thanks for contributing by reporting issues, but before you do, check that you can answer all the following questions with a firm **Yes**:
  * Have I checked the existing open issues?
  * More importantly, have I checked the existing closed issues?
  * If I've just installed or updated...
    * ... have I checked the **CHANGELOG** and the **README**?
    * ... have I tried removing and reinstalling the package and then restarting Atom to ensure Atom didn't break it?

If you've answered **Yes** to all these questions, please do tell us what the problem is (you can remove this text first).

Also, it would help to check the Atom developer tools (`View` → `Developer` → `Toggle Developer Tools`) console tab to see if there is any interesting output and include that in your report.
