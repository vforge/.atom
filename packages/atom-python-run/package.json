Please report any `python3` issues if you want to avoid installing a global `python2` version.\n\n# Documentation\n\nThis project has been documented in a fair amount of detail over time. This documentation can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/wiki).\n\n**Everyone** should take the time to reveiw the [Wiki README](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/wiki/00-Readme) at the bare minimum. It details an overview on how to handle issues, use different versions, and includes links to primary sections of the Wiki. \n\n**Everyone** should also take the time to review the Wiki section [How do I use atom-python-run?](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/wiki/12-How-Do-I-Use-atom-python-run). It covers everything from installation, to configuration, logging, and much more. You just might be surprised by what you can do with atom-python-run.\n\nYou should have the basics after having covered both the *README* and *How Do I use atom-python-run?* sections. Most FAQ's can be resolved by simply reading them. The guides provided should allow us to help you with what ever issue you're facing.\n\n**NOTE**: Be sure to read the [Wiki](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/wiki) and the [Wiki README](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/wiki/00-Readme) before reporting an issue or making a pull request. A lot of time has been put in to it to help you the user (or dev) get started and on your way.\n\n# Issues\n- Before newing an issue, check to see if someone else is experiencing any related issues.\n- Check to see if any issues that were closed resemble your issue and re-open it addressing that you're experiencing a similar issue.\n- Provide details about your issue, such as errors and/or logs.\n- Provide reproduction steps (we can't help you if we don't know how to reproduce the error!).\n\n# Development\n\nIf you're a developer and are interested in this project you can find this repos API's in the [Wiki](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/wiki). More specifically, you'll want to take a look at [How does the cp module work?](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/wiki#how-does-the-cp-module-work) and [How does the terminal.js module work?](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/wiki#how-does-the-terminal-module-work) sections of the Wiki.\n\nYou can also just read the key source files\n- [cp](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/tree/master/cp) (cp is written in python)\n- [terminal.js](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/blob/master/lib/terminal.js)\n- [atom-python-run.js](https://github.com/foreshadow/atom-python-run/blob/master/lib/atom-python-run.js)\n- New an issue if you have any idea of new features.\n\n![A screenshot of your package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif)\n\nThis is a package for Atom\n",
