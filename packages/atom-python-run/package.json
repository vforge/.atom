Open a source file.\n2. Hit `F5` or `F6` to run.\n  - **It will save the file in current editor immediately without a confirmation, be aware.**\n\n\n# Features\n\n- Using `python`\n  - Almost the same console with python IDLE, which provides syntax error and runtime error messages.\n- CodeBlocks debug console style\n  - Shows return value and execution time\n    - It is a rough time based on real time rather than CPU kernel / user time\n\n# Settings\n\n- Extension filter\n  - It accepts all extension by default (empty value), you can change it into `.py`\n    - or an array `.py, .something-else`\n\n- Command\n  - You can hack it using these variant, or\n    - `{file}` = `{dir}/{name}{ext}`\n  - Run with interactive mode, or\n    - `python -i {file}`\n  - Run with idle, and you may need the next setting.\n    - `pythonw C:\\python27\\Lib\\idlelib\\idle.pyw -r {file}`\n\n- Exit immediately\n  - You can disable the default cp wrapper if you don't want it.\n\n# Compatibility\n\n- Cross Platform Compatible\n  - Runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux\n\n- True Arbitrary Execution\n  - Global python is the default interpreter\n  - Execute using any interpreter\n  - Pass options to the given interpreter\n\n- Python 2 and 3\n  - Note: If you have problems executing, you can install a global version of latest `python2.7.x` (even if you have `python3.x.x` installed). Please report any `python3` issues if you want to avoid installing a global `python2` version.\n\n# Issues\n- The new version of atom-python-run fully supports logging.\n  - Please post these logs with along with issue you're experiencing.\n  - Note that there are two logs in case the latter fails. The first log is the console log and the second log is created by the cp main.py executable.\n\n- How to access Atoms Console Log\n  - Windows/Linux\n    - Ctrl + Shift + I\n  - Mac OS X\n    - Cmd + Alt + I\n  - Copy and paste the console output along with your post.\n\n- How to access `cp`'s built-in log\n  - Windows\n    1. Open file explorer\n    2. Click the location bar (where the file path usually is)\n    3. Type in `%userprofile%\\.atom\\packages\\atom-python-run`\n    4. Locate, Open, and Copy the contents of the cp.log file along with your post.\n  - Mac OS X/Linux\n    1. Open a terminal window.\n    `$ cat ~/.atom/packages/atom-python-run/cp.log`\n    2. Copy and paste the contents along with your post.\n  - NOTE: If the `cp.log` file is missing, empty, or inaccurate, please note that this was case in your post.\n\n- Detailed issues are well presented issues. This will help us locate your issue.\n\n- New an issue if you have any idea of new features.\n\n![A screenshot of your package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif)\n\nThis is a package for Atom\n",
