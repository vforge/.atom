# C++ and C language support for Atom-IDE

This project is still in its infancy, but the basic idea is to provide support
for C++ and C to Atom-IDE by virtue of the highly experimental LLVM tool,
[Clangd](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd.html).

**NOTE: This package does nothing yet â€” it merely exists to reserve the name.**
