This package provides refactoring capabilities for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base).

  * Method overriding.
  * Constructor generation.
  * Getter and setter generation.
  * Unimplemented abstract method generation.
  * Unimplemented interface method generation.
