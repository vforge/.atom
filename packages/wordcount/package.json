Currency symbol can be changed in Settings.\n\n\n![A screenshot of your spankin' package](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/584259/19187373/62f97ad8-8c8b-11e6-85aa-1282f94f509b.gif))\n\n*A special thanks goes to our [awesome contributors](https://github.com/nesQuick/atom-wordcount/graphs/contributors) üëè*\n",
